What is PyJEM?
=============================

Summary
---------
| In recent years, there is an increasing demand to automatically control from 
  TEM control to acquisition of images, and to control the TEM remotely. 
  Until now, it was necessary to organize programs using TEM external control 
  (TEMExt) written in C ++, but there are problems such as the high level of 
  hurdling to create programs in C ++ language and few functions available in TEMExt had.
| PyJEM solved these problems. Since PyJEM is a python library, 
  we can interactively control TEM. 
  In addition, functions available from existing TEMExt are powered up, enabling remote control.

What you can do with PyJEM
----------------------------
With PyJEM, it is relatively easy to control the TEM itself and acquire images. 
By combining this with a rich Python library you can create a variety of applications.

* **Electronic optical system control**： 
  
  Beam control, detector In / Out, magnification change, brightness change, etc..

* **Stage control**：

  Absolute position movement, Relative position movement, Piezoelectric movement, etc..

* **Image acquisition**：

  STEM or TEM image acquisition, image storage type change, resolution specification, etc..

* **Auto function**：

  Auto Focus、Auto Contrast Brightness、Auto Stigmator, etc..


Connection model
----------------------------
You can use Python environment on TEM PC or another PC and use it on PC which installed 
PyJEM (python library). When you execute the script code including PyJEM, 
processing is thrown to TEM main unit via TEMCenter.

**TEMPC**

It is a model that builds PyJEM environment in TEMPC and controls TEM.

**RemotePC**:

It is a model that builds a PyJEM environment on a PC other than TEMPC and controls TEM. 
It is possible to write python script code with NotePC (etc.) and execute it with Remote. 
When executing from a remote place, work such as having the TEM connected to the in-house LAN etc. may be necessary.

PyJEM Forum (Message Board)
----------------------------
Publish the sharing place(Forum) about PyJEM to GitHub. 
To use Forum, you need a GitHub account. In this Forum, you can share script code, 
exchange information, and browse. From JEOL, 
we will publish manuals such as how to use PyJEM and answer questions about PyJEM.
